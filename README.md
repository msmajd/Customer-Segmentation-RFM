ustomer Segmentation & Growth Opportunity Analysis
 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer purchasing behavior to identify high-value customers and key growth opportunities. Using RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) combined with K-Means clustering, customers are segmented into actionable groups that support data-driven marketing and retention strategies.

The analysis is performed using Python, and insights are visualized through interactive Power BI dashboards designed for business stakeholders.

 Key Insights

Customers were segmented into Champions, Loyal Customers, Potential Loyalists, and At Risk groups.

Potential Loyalists represent the largest revenue growth opportunity due to their size and strong current contribution.

Champions deliver the highest individual customer value but offer limited scalability.

Targeted strategies can significantly increase customer lifetime value.

 Business Recommendations

Focus marketing efforts on Potential Loyalists to increase frequency and spending.

Maintain engagement with Champions through loyalty and exclusivity programs.

Apply upselling strategies to Loyal Customers.

Launch re-engagement campaigns for At Risk customers.

 Dashboards

Interactive dashboards were built in Power BI to present insights in an executive-friendly format, including:

Customer segmentation overview

Revenue contribution by segment

Cluster-level behavioral analysis

Growth opportunity identification

 Outcome

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow, transforming raw transactional data into actionable business insights and supporting real-world decision-making.
